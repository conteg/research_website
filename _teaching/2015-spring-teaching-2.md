This is a description of a teaching experience. You can use markdown like any other post.

1. Derive econometric estimators for linear regression, panel data and limited dependent variable models

2. Show the properties of these estimators and understand the underlying assumptions required

3. Derive appropriate tests for the underlying assumptions and correct for violations of these assumptions

4. Confidently discuss the challenge of identification in empirical research

5. Select the appropriate econometric approach for different data and empirical settings

6. Use STATA to apply these techniques in practice.
